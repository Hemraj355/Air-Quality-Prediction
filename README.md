# Air Quality Prediction and Analysis using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **environmental monitoring and pollution control**, specifically predicting and analyzing **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using Machine Learning techniques. Poor air quality has direct impacts on human health and the environment, making it a crucial area for AI-driven insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Explore and analyze air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, etc.).
- Preprocess and clean the dataset.
- Train ML models to predict Air Quality Index (AQI).
- Compare performance of different algorithms.
- (Optional) Deploy as a simple web app for visualization and prediction.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: [Air Quality Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)  
- **Description**: Historical air pollution data across multiple Indian cities (2015â€“2020) with AQI levels.

## ðŸ›  Project Plan (AI/ML Lifecycle)
1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Load dataset, check shape, missing values, descriptive stats.
2. **Visualization** â€“ Histograms, pollutant trends, correlation heatmap.
3. **Preprocessing** â€“ Handle missing values, scaling, feature engineering.
4. **Model Training** â€“ Train models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Compare accuracy, RMSE, RÂ².
6. **Deployment (Optional)** â€“ Build a Streamlit/Flask app for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“… Week 1 Deliverables
- âœ… Finalized project title  
- âœ… Chosen dataset  
- âœ… Initial plan documented  
- âœ… Dataset loaded & basic exploration in Jupyter Notebook  

## âœ… Week 2 Progress
- Completed data preprocessing (missing values handled, date converted, City & AQI_Bucket encoded).
- Feature selection finalized (pollutants + City as features; AQI_Bucket as target).
- Trainâ€“test split (80/20) applied.
- Trained & tested Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.
- Evaluated with accuracy & classification report; added comparison chart.
- Best performer this week: SVM (high accuracy).

## âœ… Week 3 Progress
Performed detailed model evaluation, confusion matrices, and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV). Final tuned model: SVM (C=1, kernel=linear, gamma=scale), saved as final_best_model.pkl. Notebook: week3_air_quality.ipynb
